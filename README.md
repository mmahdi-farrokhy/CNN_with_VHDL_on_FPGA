# CNN_with_VHDL_on_FPGA
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network on FPGA Virtex7 using VHDL

In this project my partner and I designed a CNN machine learning system
with VHDL on FPGA family Virtex7.
The Implementation and Testbench files are included in this repository
along side with the .xise project file.
